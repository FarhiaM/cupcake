# Cupcake web site

Cupcake web site is a simple Vue.js project. It was built using reusable components (ex: header, footer, etc) and different views connected each other.  

Also, to develop the project we use some tools such as google maps and vue-carousel package.  

The user could find a web site, in the home page there are some buttons that allow them navigate between all the website content.
